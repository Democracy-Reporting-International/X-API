# X API 
Welcome to the DRI Digital Democracy Github! Here you will find documentation for working with the X (formerly Twitter) API and lessons learned from past DD projects that required X access.
Attached in the folder is a document that can guide you through working with the X API, as well as cleaned versions of the code used from past projects

# Best Practice
After completing a project involving X, we kindly ask that you upload any scripts (ideally cleaned) to this repository for future reference.

Thanks!
